### **How Agents Work in This System**

Agents are specialized tools or mechanisms that use AI models to analyze, process, and respond to specific tasks or queries. In this system, agents are built using **LangChain**, **OpenAI embeddings**, and other AI-powered tools to automate email management and FAQ generation.

---

### **What Are Agents?**

Agents are decision-making components powered by AI. They can:

1. **Understand Natural Language Queries:**
   - Accept queries in plain English, like *"Show me all emails requiring action."*
   
2. **Perform Specific Actions:**
   - Categorize emails into meaningful groups.
   - Summarize email content.
   - Generate FAQs from conversations.
   - Respond to user queries using the knowledge base.

3. **Interact Dynamically:**
   - Use a knowledge base (vector database) to provide accurate and context-aware responses.

---

### **Agent Roles in This System**

#### **1. Categorization Agent**
- **Purpose:** Classify emails into categories like:
  - *Action Needed*, *Promotions*, *Archived*, etc.
- **How It Works:**
  - Uses the **OpenAI GPT API** to read email content.
  - Based on the content and rules, assigns categories and importance levels.
- **Example:**
  - Query: *"Classify this email."*
  - Response: *"This email belongs to 'Promotions' and is 'Low Importance'."*

---

#### **2. FAQ Generation Agent**
- **Purpose:** Extract FAQs from past email conversations (sent emails).
- **How It Works:**
  - Scans cleaned email threads for patterns like:
    - Questions asked.
    - Responses provided.
  - Uses GPT to format FAQs into:
    - *Question: What is X?*
    - *Answer: X is...*
- **Example:**
  - Input: *Sent email containing a reply about pricing.*
  - Output: *"Question: What are the pricing options?"*

---

#### **3. Knowledge Base Agent**
- **Purpose:** Use the cleaned data (emails, FAQs, etc.) to answer user queries intelligently.
- **How It Works:**
  - Combines all cleaned data into a **vectorized knowledge base** using **Chroma**.
  - Uses semantic search to retrieve relevant answers.
  - When you ask a question (e.g., *"What tasks are due this week?"*), the agent searches the database for similar topics and provides responses.
- **Example:**
  - Query: *"Show me all emails related to interview scheduling."*
  - Response: *Returns a summary of emails matching this category.*

---

### **How Agents Interact With the System**

1. **Input:** A user query or raw email thread.
2. **Processing:** 
   - The agent uses AI models (e.g., GPT) and logic to analyze the input.
   - It queries the **vectorized knowledge base** or processes raw email data.
3. **Output:** Provides a meaningful response or action.

---

### **Key Technologies Enabling Agents**

1. **LangChain Framework:**
   - Used to chain together tasks like categorization, semantic search, and query handling.
   - Enables seamless interactions between different agents.

2. **OpenAI GPT Models:**
   - Core AI engine behind all agents.
   - Provides language understanding, summarization, and natural language processing.

3. **Vector Databases (Chroma):**
   - Stores all cleaned and categorized data as embeddings.
   - Enables fast and accurate retrieval of relevant information.

4. **Text Splitters:**
   - Handles large email threads by breaking them into manageable chunks for analysis.

---

### **How It All Comes Together**

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - `.mbox` files are converted to `.csv`.
   - Emails are cleaned and categorized into types (action-needed, archived, etc.).

2. **FAQ Generation:**
   - Sent emails are analyzed to extract common questions and answers.

3. **Knowledge Base Creation:**
   - FAQs, email pairs, and promotional content are embedded into a **vectorized knowledge base**.

4. **Interactive Querying:**
   - The app (`app.py`) allows users to interact with agents.
   - Queries are processed by:
     - **Categorization Agent:** Returns classified emails.
     - **FAQ Agent:** Retrieves FAQs for specific topics.
     - **Knowledge Base Agent:** Searches the knowledge base for answers.

---

### **Example Use Cases**

1. **Query Emails by Category:**
   - *"Show me all emails marked as 'Action Needed'."*
   - The agent fetches relevant emails using the vectorized knowledge base.

2. **Generate Summaries:**
   - *"Summarize all archived emails from last week."*
   - The agent reads the archived email data and generates concise summaries.

3. **Generate FAQs:**
   - *"What are the most common questions asked about project deadlines?"*
   - The FAQ agent pulls related questions and answers.

---

### **Why Agents Are Powerful**

1. **Automation:**
   - Saves time by categorizing and cleaning emails automatically.
   - Handles repetitive tasks like FAQ generation without human intervention.

2. **Context-Aware Responses:**
   - Agents use Zeel's resume and knowledge base to provide accurate, personalized answers.

3. **Scalability:**
   - With embeddings, the system can handle thousands of emails efficiently.

4. **Interactivity:**
   - Users can directly query the system for specific needs without manual searching.
